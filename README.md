# C# for Web Development Bootcamp

Welcome to the repository for our online Coding Dojo C# for Web Development bootcamp, hosted by instructor Alaa Taieb. This repository will serve as your main resource for all the code snippets, project files and other relevant resources utilized during our live coding sessions.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by week. For every week of our course, you will find a separate folder titled "Week [number]". Each of these weekly folders will contain two sub-folders: 

- Session 1
- Session 2

Each of these sessions corresponds to one of the two lectures we conduct each week.

## Accessing the Material

To access the material, navigate to the week and then to the specific session you are interested in. All code and relevant files will be contained within these session folders.

## Updates

New material will be pushed to this repository after each session. You will be able to identify the most recent changes by referring to the commit description, which follows the format "Week [number] session [number]". This format will help you track the progression of the course and easily find the content relevant to each session.

We advise checking this repository regularly to keep up-to-date with the latest course material.
